# 🚀 Python Execution Flowchart Repository

Welcome to the **Python Execution Flowchart** repository! This repository showcases a **visually interactive flowchart** that explains the execution lifecycle of Python code, from writing a script to execution at the machine level.

## 📜 Overview

This repository contains a **detailed flowchart** that illustrates the execution process of a Python program. The flowchart breaks down the key execution stages:

1. **Application Layer** – Where Python source code (`.py`) is written.
2. **Compiler Layer** – Translates Python code into bytecode (`.pyc`).
3. **PVM (Python Virtual Machine) Layer** – Loads and executes the bytecode.
4. **OS Layer** – Interacts with the operating system to execute the code at the machine level.

Each stage includes **key components** such as dynamic typing, bytecode caching, execution stack management, JIT compilation, and exception handling.

## 🎯 Features

- 📌 **Interactive & Visual Representation** – The flowchart is designed with icons and color-coded sections.
- 🔍 **Detailed Execution Path** – Step-by-step breakdown of Python’s execution process.
- ⚡ **Optimization Techniques** – Covers performance enhancements like JIT compilation, multi-threading, and memory management.
- 🛠 **Advanced Execution Flow** – Includes async execution, garbage collection, and profiling tools.
